Hey, I’m Irene. You can call me Irene, with the proper pronunciation. Some of my friends also call me Ite, you are free to do that, too. I’m a full-time student with a little time to spare to do design jobs and voluntary works, which I’ll elaborate further in my posts.

I’m seventeen, the most glorious age of human’s lifetime. Raging hormones, fired up spirits, and of course, blooming procrastination.

This blog is supposed to be a school project, but I do not want to treat it that way, because then it would be lame. I don’t do lame, darling I only do awesome. The name of this blog is pretty historical, I’m damn proud.

Peng– It’s a history. It’s a name I made for myself when I was acting as a Thai person in a school drama. The drama was lame, but it was pretty funny. I began to love the name. Look, I even made my own nickname.

Thaiorganicrice– Of course Peng should have a company shouldn’t she? I went through thousands of domains available on freedns and look for the term “thai”. This fits the best, so I picked it for my holy blog.

My friends tell me that I’m weird. They are.

My favorite musician is Two Door Cinema Club and I love food.

I am very lazy and very very forgetful. People tend to relate to that, but believe me you do not relate to my kind of forgetful. I suffer from a kind of a special disorder called IKoF Syndrome. IKoF stands for Irene’s Kind of Forgetful.

I am tone deaf but I love to sing just to annoy the hell out of people. My sister often tells me to shut up when I’m singing in church. Why, I’m praising the Lord!

I made a thousand blogs. I learned to love coding. I want to be a tech girl.

I will have separate posts to elaborate that. Worry none.

I have one sister, one mom, and one dad in my nuclear family. My sister studies medicine in Airlangga University in Surabaya. I should also have a separate post of this, but I just want to brag right now so let me.
